# Inky Dash
[Inky Dash](https://github.com/r-rayns/inky_dash) is an interface for [Inky pHAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-phat?variant=12549254217811), an ePaper display for the Raspberry Pi, that can be accessed from a browser via a local web server. I wanted a fast and easy way to upload images to the ePaper display.

The project is structured as a monorepo with the server and UI code bundled together. By treating the application as a whole it meant fewer steps were needed to deploy and run it.

## âœ¨ Update (06/02/2025) - rewrite
