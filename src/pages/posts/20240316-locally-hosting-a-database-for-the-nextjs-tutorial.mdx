# Locally hosting a database for the Next.js tutorial

When recently working my way through the Next.js tutorial I came to "Chapter 6: Setting Up Your Database"<sup>[1](#notes)</sup>.
The chapter guides you through creating a Vercel account and setting up a PostgreSQL database in the Vercel cloud. I didn't fancy doing this,
instead I wanted to run a PostgreSQL database locally inside a Docker container...

## Prerequisites

- Reached chapter six of the Next.js tutorial<sup>[1](#notes)</sup>
- Docker CLI setup and installed on your system<sup>[2](#notes)</sup>

## Creating a PostgreSQL container

Create a new file called "docker-compose.yml" at the root of your Next.js tutorial project directory:

```bash
> cd nextjs-dashboard
> touch docker-compose.yml
```

Copy the following into your "docker-compose.yml" file and set values for the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variables.
This compose file will create a Docker container running PostgreSQL.

```yaml
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: "postgres:latest"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: "" # <-- enter a user name for postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "" # <-- enter a password for postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: "nextjstutorial"
    ports:
      # Map port 5432 of the container to port 5432 on the host machine
      - "5432:5432"
```

From the root of your project execute the following in the terminal, to start the Docker container:

<Figure caption="The *-d* flag runs the container in the background">
```bash
> sudo docker compose up -d
```
</Figure>

If you now check, you should see the container is running:

```bash
> sudo docker container ls -a

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
f652b578efd0   postgres:latest   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   2 days ago    Up 51 seconds   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, :::5432->5432/tcp   nextjs-dashboard-postgres-1
```

## Seeding the database
In the Next.js tutorial you need to seed the database, populating it with the fake data.

Now if we were to setup the .env file and run `npm run seed` it would fail with an "ECONNREFUSED" on port **443** error message.
This is because the vercel/postgres package is designed to run with a [Neon PostgreSQL database](https://github.com/neondatabase/neon)
which communicates using WebSockets on the HTTPS port **443**.

We need to swap the vercel/postgres package for a package that can communicate with our database over the standard PostgreSQL port of **5432**.

A popular PostgreSQL client for Node.js is the node-postgres (pg) package. Install it via npm:

```bash
> npm i pg
```

### Setting up the .env file
The pg package requires a different .env configuration than the one provided in the tutorial.

If you haven't already, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set it to the below. Fill in the username and password you created
when setting up the database.

```yaml
PGUSER= #POSTGRES_USER
PGHOST=localhost
PGPASSWORD= #POSTGRES_PASSWORD
PGDATABASE=nextjstutorial
PGPORT=5432

# `openssl rand -base64 32`
AUTH_SECRET=AFmE3CXmVQkZQCEqfnLCyvmpf4KRWEru
AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth
```

### Altering seed.js

Now we need to update the script that seeds the database (`scripts/seed.js`) to use the
pg client.

Remove the import of vercel/postgres and replace it with the following
import:

```javascript
const { Client } = require('pg');
```

At the bottom of the file modify the main function so that it uses pg to initialise the client.

```javascript
async function main() {
  // will automatically pick-up env vars defined in .env file
  const client = new Client();
  await client.connect();

  await seedUsers(client);
  await seedCustomers(client);
  await seedInvoices(client);
  await seedRevenue(client);

  await client.end();
}
```

Finally we need to replace all calls to `client.sql` with `client.query` and invoke the function
with parenthesis and not a template literal. For example:

```javascript
async function seedUsers(client) {
  try {
    await client.query(`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"`);
    // Create the "users" table if it doesn't exist
    const createTable = await client.query(`
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        password TEXT NOT NULL
        );
    `);
```

*Don't forget to paramatarise any variables!*

<Figure caption="Paramatarise any variables">
```javascript
const insertedUsers = await Promise.all(
  users.map(async (user) => {
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10);
    // parameterized query
    return client.query(`
    INSERT INTO users (id, name, email, password)
    VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
    ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;`,
      [user.id, user.name, user.email, hashedPassword]);
  }),
);
```
</Figure>

Make sure you have defined the "seed" npm script in your package.json file.

```json
"seed": "node -r dotenv/config ./scripts/seed.js"
```

Now when you run the seed script everything should work!

```bash
> npm run seed
```

## Drop-in repalacement

Updating the seed script is a one off as it is outside of the main application.
If you look at the queries performed in the main application code they use the
vercel/postgres sql function and are all structred something like this:

```typescript
sql<Revenue>`SELECT * FROM revenue`
```

We don't want to have to go through the rest of the code base and update all the queries.
Instead it would be much easier and more effcient if we could simply create a similar function
with the same name that we could simple swap in.

Create a new file in `app/lib/` called `db.ts` with the following content:

```typescript
// based on example provided here: https://github.com/vercel/examples/issues/701#issuecomment-1950288726
import { Pool, QueryResult, QueryResultRow } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool();

function sqlTemplate(strings: TemplateStringsArray, ...values: Primitive[]): [string, Primitive[]] {
  if (!isTemplateStringsArray(strings) || !Array.isArray(values)) {
    // strings is not a template strings array, meaning this function was not invoked using a template literal
    throw new Error(`It looks like you tried to call "sql" as a function. Make sure to use it as a tagged template.
    Example: sql\`SELECT * FROM users\`, not sql('SELECT * FROM users')`);
  }

  // get the start of the query
  let result = strings[0] ?? '';

  for (let i = 1; i < strings.length; i++) {
    // construct the rest of the query placing tokens to represent parametrized values, e.g. $1, $2, $3 etc...
    result += `$${i}${strings[i] ?? ''}`;
  }

  return [result, values];
}

function isTemplateStringsArray(strings: unknown): strings is TemplateStringsArray {
  // raw is the string as it was entered including escape sequences e.g. \n
  return (
    Array.isArray(strings) && 'raw' in strings && Array.isArray(strings.raw)
  );
}

// TemplateStringsArray is the type for template literals see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals
export async function sql<T extends QueryResultRow>(strings: TemplateStringsArray, ...values: Primitive[]): Promise<QueryResult<T>> {
  const [query, parameters] = sqlTemplate(strings, ...values);

  return pool.query<T>(query, parameters);
}

type Primitive = string | number | boolean | undefined | null;

```

This script is based on an example given in a GitHub issue thread on the same subject.<sup>[3](#notes)</sup>

### Client pool
At the top of the file we initialise a new pool. A pool allows us to "checkout" a ready-to-go PostgreSQL client
and then check the client back in once we are done. Using a pool avoids having to establish a client
connection to the database each time we want to interact with it. You can read more about them [here](https://node-postgres.com/features/pooling).

### The sql function
From this file we export a function called "sql". This is our drop-in replacement for the vercel "sql" function.
Like the original it can be invoked using a template literal.
Functions that can be invoked in this fashion are called a "Tag Function"<sup>[4](#notes)</sup>.

The first argument to a tag function is the template literal broken down into an array with each
expression serving as a delimeter. The second argument is all the expressions contained in the template.

For example if we were to call the function like so:

```typescript
const name = 'Bob';
const occupation = 'cyber security';
sql`SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = ${name} AND occupation = ${occupation}`
```

Then the "strings" argument would be an array of two strings, split where the expressions occured:

```javascript
["SELECT * FROM customer WHERE name = ", " AND occupation = "]`
```

The "values" argument would be the values held by the expressions:

```javascript
["Bob", "cyber security"]
```

### The sqlTemplate function

The sqlTemplate function can take the strings and the values passed to the sql function and return
a paramatarised query along with the values.

Following on from our previous example it would return:

```javascript
["SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = $1 AND occupation = $2", ["Bob", "cyber security"]]
```

These can then be used to run the query!

```typescript
const [query, parameters] = sqlTemplate(strings, ...values);
// run the query!
return pool.query<T>(query, parameters);
```

The final step is to simply go into `app/lib/data.js` and replace the import of the original
sql function with an import of our newly created sql function.

```typescript
// import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';
import { sql } from './db';
```
Aside from having a nice drop-in replacement for the original vercel/postgres function. By having all our queries
go through the same function we only need to make a change in one location for it to affect all our queries. For
example we could add some performance logging to our "sql" function.

```typescript
export async function sql<T extends QueryResultRow>(strings: TemplateStringsArray, ...values: Primitive[]): Promise<QueryResult<T>> {
  const [query, parameters] = sqlTemplate(strings, ...values);

  const timer: string = 'Query performed in';
  console.time(timer);
  const result = pool.query<T>(query, parameters);
  console.timeEnd(timer);

  return result;
}

```
