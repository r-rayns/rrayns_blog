# Building a custom Leaflet control with React Leaflet

I found myself needing to build a legend control using the [React Leaflet library](https://react-leaflet.js.org/).
React Leaflet is a convenient library that abstracts Leaflet into React components and provides an interface between the two.

My initial attempt was to create a control following the example provided in the official documentation<sup>[1](#notes)</sup>,
which suggested using CSS classes like `leaflet-bottom` and `leaflet-left` for positioning. While this approach rendered
the control correctly, I discovered that it existed outside Leaflet's internal DOM container for controls.
This independence from Leaflet's layout flow causes positioning conflicts where custom controls will overlap and clash
with other controls ü´£.

<Figure caption="Custom legend control overlapping the zoom control">
  <Image src={leafletControlOverlapImage}
         class="mx-auto"

         alt="Overlapping Leaflet controls"
         loading="eager"/>
</Figure>

## Map Control Component

To solve this problem, we'll create a component that registers a Leaflet control and uses a React
portal<sup>[2](#notes)</sup> to render child components inside it. This will allow us to build React controls that are
then rendered directly within Leaflet's internal DOM, improving the integration of our custom control and resolving
the overlap issue.

### Props
First, define an interface for the props that our parent component will use:

<Figure caption="TypeScript interface representing the props">
```typescript
export interface MapControlProps {
  position: ControlPosition;
  disableClickPropagation?: boolean;
}
```
</Figure>

The `position` prop is any valid Leaflet control position that places the control on the map. These can be any of the four
following strings: `topleft`, `topright`, `bottomleft`, `bottomright`.

The other prop `disableClickPropagation` is a boolean value, which when true prevents clicks on the control from escaping
to the map beneath. This is useful if you wish to allow the user to highlight text within the control.


### Component Skeleton

Next let's create a skeleton for our control. We know that it will need to render a child node inside a portal, so
we'll start there.

<Figure caption="Map control component skeleton">
```tsx
export function MapControl({position, disableClickPropagation, children}: PropsWithChildren<MapControlProps>) {
  const [container, setContainer] = useState<HTMLElement | null>(null);

  // TODO - register a new Leaflet control and get its reference

  return container ? createPortal(children, container) : null;
}
```
</Figure>

The `container` state will hold a reference to the Leaflet control element and using `createPortal` we will be able to render
child components inside it.

### Registering a new Leaflet control

To create a new control instance we can use Leaflets `Control` class. Then use the `onAdd` method to return an empty
`<section>` element when the control is added to the map. The `container` state will be updated to hold a reference to
this element.

To add the control to the map we need a reference to the map itself. React Leaflet provides a `useMap` hook that returns a reference to
the map for any descendants of the `MapContainer`. We will use it here when adding our control.

Finally, so that our map control renders whenever a prop changes, we place all this logic inside a `useEffect` hook, and the
props within its dependency array.

<Figure caption="Creating a new Leaflet control">
```tsx
const map = useMap();

useEffect(() => {
  // Create a new map control
  const mapControl = new Control({position});

  mapControl.onAdd = () => {
    const section = DomUtil.create('section');
    if (disableClickPropagation === true) {
      // All click events will stop at the control and not pass through to the map
      DomEvent.disableClickPropagation(section);
    }
  }

  // Add the control to the map
  map.addControl(mapControl);
  // Store the container element to use in the portal
  setContainer(mapControl.getContainer() ?? null);

  // Clean up when the component unmounts
  return () => {
    map.removeControl(mapControl);
  }
},[map, position, disableClickPropagation]);
```
</Figure>

The `position` prop is passed to the `Control` constructor and will determine where the control is placed within the map.
If the `disableClickPropagation` prop is true then using the `DomEvent` utility class we prevent clicks on the control
passing through to the map beneath.

Lastly, a clean up function is returned so, should the component unmount, the control will be safely removed from the map before
the next one is created.

### Usage

Our final `MapControl` component should look something like this.

<Figure caption="Our MapControl component in full">
```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useMap } from 'react-leaflet';
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';
import { Control, DomEvent, DomUtil } from 'leaflet';
import type { ControlPosition } from 'leaflet';
import type { PropsWithChildren } from 'react';

export interface MapControlProps {
  position: ControlPosition;
  disableClickPropagation?: boolean;
}

export function MapControl({position, disableClickPropagation, children}: PropsWithChildren<MapControlProps>) {
  const [container, setContainer] = useState<HTMLElement | null>(null);
  const map = useMap();

  useEffect(() => {
    // Create a new map control
    const mapControl = new Control({position});

    mapControl.onAdd = () => {
      const section = DomUtil.create('section');
      if (disableClickPropagation === true) {
        // All click events will stop at the control and not pass through to the map
        DomEvent.disableClickPropagation(section);
      }
      return section;
    };

    // Add the control to the map
    map.addControl(mapControl);

    // Store the container element to use in the portal
    setContainer(mapControl.getContainer() ?? null);

    // Clean up when the component unmounts
    return () => {
      map.removeControl(mapControl);
    };
  }, [map, position, disableClickPropagation]);

  return container ? createPortal(children, container) : null;
}
```
</Figure>

We can now use the `MapControl` to render any child components inside a Leaflet control.

<Figure caption="Using the MapControl component">
```tsx
export default function Map() {
  // ...

  return (
    <MapContainer center={[0, 0]}
                  zoom={15}
                  style={{height: "100%", width: "100%"}}>
      <TileLayer
        attribution='&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
        url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
      />
      <MapControl position="topleft" disableClickPropagation={true}>
        <div className="leaflet-bar leaflet-touch p-2 bg-white text-slate-800">
          <p>A Custom Control!</p>
        </div>
      </MapControl>
    </MapContainer>
  )
}
```
</Figure>

Here we have a custom control that renders a `<div>` with some text. The `leaflet-bar` and `leaflet-touch` classes are
just some classes from Leaflet that we can use to keep the style of the control consistent with the default Leaflet appearance.

When we view our map now, we will see our custom control at the top left of the map below the native zoom control. No overlap üôå!

<Figure caption="Our custom control rendered on the map">
  <Image src={leafletCustomControlImage}
         class="mx-auto"
         title="Custom Leaflet control"
         alt="Custom Leaflet control"/>
</Figure>

## Problem Solved
With the `MapControl` component I can go back and supply my legend control as a child and it should no longer have
positioning issues.

<Figure caption="Supplying MapLegend as a child of MapControl">
```tsx
<MapControl position="topleft" disableClickPropagation={true}>
  <MapLegend entries={cathedralLegend}/>
</MapControl>
```
</Figure>

Success! My custom legend control as been integrated with Leaflet's internal layout flow ü•≥.
<Figure caption="My legend control no longer overlaps!">
  <Image src={leafletCustomLegendImage}
         class="mx-auto"
         title="Custom Leaflet control"
         alt="Custom Leaflet control"/>
</Figure>

### Comparison with other approaches

Alternatively, React Leaflet provides a function called `createControlComponent`<sup>[3](#notes)</sup>.
This function wraps a Leaflet Control class in a React component, making it particularly valuable when integrating
existing Leaflet controls.

A typical `createControlComponent` approach might look something like this:

<Figure caption="Using React Leaflet's createControlComponent function">
```tsx
// Leaflet Control defined using Leaflet's Control class
const InfoControlDefinition = Control.extend({
  onAdd: (map) => {
    const container = DomUtil.create('section');
    container.innerHTML = `
      <div class="leaflet-bar leaflet-touch">
        <p>A Custom Control!</p>
        <button class="info-button">‚ÑπÔ∏è</button>
      </div>`;

    // Manual event handling
    const infoButton = container.querySelector('.info-button');
    infoButton?.addEventListener('click', () => {
      console.log('Info clicked!');
    });

    return container;
  },

  onRemove: (map) => {
    // Clean-up, remove event listeners, etc...
  }
});

export const InfoControl = createControlComponent((props) => new InfoControlDefinition(props));

// Usage:
<InfoControl position="bottomright" />

```
</Figure>

This approach can be useful when integrating with existing Leaflet plugins or when you're already familiar with the
traditional Leaflet control creation API. However, it often requires working with string-based markup and
manual event handling.

The React portal approach I've demonstrated offers an alternative solution with a couple of advantages:

1) ‚öõÔ∏è **React-centric development**: You can write controls using JSX/TSX syntax. This provides all the benefits of
React's component model and avoids string-based markup and manual event handling.
2) ‚ôªÔ∏è **Reusability**: The MapControl component encapsulates the integration logic, making it easy to create multiple different controls.

Importantly, the portal approach doesn't sacrifice any functionality from Leaflet's API - you still have complete access
to the map instance and all Leaflet's features through the useMap hook.
